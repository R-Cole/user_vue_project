## Highlight User Logins Project
There are 2 pages. On each page of the application a table displays the values found in users.json. By default this table displays all rows with a white background. 

On page 1, there is a button that, when clicked all user rows with a login count of 0 are highlighted with a red background. 

On page 2, there is a button that, when clicked all user rows with a login count of 1 or more are highlighted with a green background. 

When the button is clicked again on either page the default non-highlighted view displays.
